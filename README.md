Stealing Fire from the gods! (Again!)
Requires NodeJS, and a Twitter Premium Sub.
Open twitter, send a request to Grok, Open Developer tools (f12). Grab your authtoken, cookie header, and csrftoken and throw them into config.json
Start the program with run.bat (or make a sh, if you're on linux you can handle that, atleast right?)
Connect to "http://localhost:3004" in your sillytavern under openai compatible, and boom! Grok in ST.
